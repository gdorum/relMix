Description: 
  Analysis of DNA mixtures involving relatives by computation of likelihood ratios that account for dropout and drop-in, mutations, silent alleles and population 
  substructure. This is useful in kinship cases, like non-invasive prenatal paternity testing, where deductions about individuals' relationships rely on DNA mixtures, 
  and in criminal cases where the contributors to a mixed DNA stain may be related. Relationships are represented 
  by pedigrees and can include kinship between more than two individuals. The main function is relMix() and its graphical user interface relMixGUI(). 
  The implementation and method is described in Dorum et al. (2017) <doi:10.1007/s00414-016-1526-x>, Hernandis et al. (2019)
